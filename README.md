## üöÄ About The Project

Generous is a web-based platform designed for collaborative application development and prototyping. It leverages a visual canvas interface combined with real-time communication features and AI assistance to streamline the building process for teams.

Users can interact within chat rooms, visualize components or workflows on a canvas, and receive AI-generated responses or code suggestions, fostering a dynamic and efficient development environment.

### üí° Motivation

The Generous platform was created to address the challenges of remote collaborative development. By combining visual tools, AI assistance, and real-time communication, we aim to make development more accessible and efficient for teams of all sizes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Chat rooms with shared canvas interactions powered by Pusher Channels
- **AI Assistance:** Integration with multiple AI models:
  - OpenAI (GPT models) for sophisticated text responses
  - Google Gemini for alternative AI capabilities
  - XAI (Grok) for additional AI functionality
- **Visual Canvas:** Interactive visualization components for prototyping and ideation
- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up, sign-in, and password management using Supabase Auth
- **Audio Communication:** Integration with Dyte SDK for real-time audio/video conversations
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Audio playback for messages and AI responses
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive UI with light and dark theme support
- **Profile Management:** Customizable user profiles and settings

## üîê Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables. Obtain the necessary keys and secrets from the respective service providers (Supabase, Pusher, OpenAI, etc.).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive information that should remain private.

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key # !!! Keep this secret - Used by the worker

PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key          # Same as NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY
PUSHER_SECRET=your_pusher_secret    # !!! Keep this secret - Used by the worker
PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_pusher_cluster  # Same as NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER

# AI Provider Keys

GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key  # Required if using Google Gemini models
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key                   # Required if using XAI Grok models
USE_XAI=true                                   # Set to "true" to enable XAI (Grok) models
DEBUG_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini                        # Specify model for debugging

# Dyte Audio/Video Configuration
DYTE_ORG_ID=your_dyte_org_id
DYTE_API_KEY=your_dyte_api_key
DYTE_AUTH_HEADER=your_dyte_auth_header         # Usually Basic + base64 encoded credentials

# Worker Configuration
PORT=3001                                      # Port for the worker process (default: 3001)
```

**Important Security Notes:**

- The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` and `PUSHER_SECRET` are highly sensitive and should never be exposed publicly
- We recommend using environment-specific `.env` files (`.env.development`, `.env.production`) for different settings
- Consider using a secrets manager for production deployments

## üö¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account and project.
- A [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels/) account and app.
- API keys for the AI providers you intend to use (OpenAI, Google, XAI).
- (Optional) A [Dyte](https://dyte.io/) account if using audio/video features.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/generouschat/generous.git # Replace with your repo URL if different
    cd generous
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    - Copy the variables listed in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section into your `.env` file.
    - Fill in the values with your actual keys and credentials from Supabase, Pusher, AI providers, etc.

4.  **Set up Supabase Database:**

    - You might need to run SQL migrations provided by the project (if any) or set up the required tables (`chat_rooms`, `messages`, `room_participants`, potentially others) manually in your Supabase dashboard based on the code (`app/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx`, `worker/services/supabase.ts`).
    - Ensure RLS (Row Level Security) policies are appropriately configured for security.
    - Enable the `realtime` functionality for the tables the worker listens to (`messages`, `room_participants`).

5.  **Build the worker:**
    ```bash
    npm run worker:build
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, you need to start both the Next.js frontend and the backend worker process.

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will typically start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the worker process (in a separate terminal):**
    ```bash
    npm run worker:dev
    ```
    This will start the worker, usually on port 3001 (or the `PORT` specified in `.env`). Watch this terminal for logs from the worker, including Supabase connection status, Pusher events, and AI interactions.

Now you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìú Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js frontend in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the Next.js frontend for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js frontend production server.
- `npm run worker:dev`: Starts the worker process in development mode using `tsx` (with hot-reloading).
- `npm run worker:build`: Compiles the worker TypeScript code to JavaScript (`dist/` directory).
- `npm run worker:start`: Starts the compiled worker process from the `dist/` directory (for production).
