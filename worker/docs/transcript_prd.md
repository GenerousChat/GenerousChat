# Product Requirements Document: Speech Transcription System

## Overview
The Speech Transcription System is designed to capture human speech in real-time, convert it to text, and intelligently manage the interaction between human speech and AI-generated audio responses. This document outlines the requirements, features, and implementation details for this system.

## Problem Statement
During conversations with AI agents, there's often an overlap when a human starts speaking while the AI is still providing audio output. This creates a poor user experience as both voices compete for attention. The system needs to detect when a human begins speaking and immediately stop any ongoing AI audio output.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Speech Detection and Transcription
- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Capture and transcribe human speech in real-time using browser's Web Speech API
- **Multi-browser Support**: Ensure compatibility across major browsers where the Web Speech API is supported
- **Continuous Listening**: Maintain an active listening state to detect speech at any time during the interaction
- **Interim Results**: Process partial speech results to enable quick response to detected human speech

### 2. TTS (Text-to-Speech) Management
- **Immediate TTS Interruption**: When human speech is detected, immediately stop all AI/agent TTS output
- **Queue Clearing**: Clear the entire queue of pending TTS messages when human speech is detected
- **Graceful Interruption**: Ensure the interruption of AI speech is handled without audio artifacts or system errors
- **Resilient Implementation**: The TTS system must be highly resilient to edge cases, network issues, and browser inconsistencies
- **Persistent State Management**: Implement rigorous state tracking to prevent TTS from stopping unexpectedly during extended sessions
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically recover from errors without requiring user intervention or page refreshes
- **Consistent Audio Output**: Ensure consistent audio output quality and reliability throughout long conversations

### 3. User Interface
- **Transcription Controls**: Provide clear UI controls to start and stop the transcription process
- **Status Indicators**: Display the current state of the transcription system (active/inactive)
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the transcription UI is fully accessible and compliant with WCAG guidelines

## Technical Implementation

### Speech Recognition Component
- Utilize the Web Speech API (specifically `webkitSpeechRecognition`)
- Configure for continuous recognition with interim results
- Implement error handling for unsupported browsers or recognition failures

### TTS Management System
- Create a centralized TTS manager that controls all AI audio output
- Implement a method to immediately terminate active speech and clear the queue
- Establish an event-based system to trigger TTS interruption when speech is detected
- Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Use a robust state machine approach to manage TTS states with strict transitions
- Include detailed logging and diagnostics to identify and address issues
- Implement periodic state verification to detect and correct inconsistencies

### Integration Points
- Connect the speech recognition system to the TTS manager
- Implement a callback system that triggers when any speech is detected
- Ensure low latency between speech detection and TTS interruption

## User Experience Flow
1. User activates the transcription system
2. System begins listening for speech while AI interaction continues normally
3. When user begins speaking, system:
   - Immediately detects the speech activity
   - Cuts off any currently playing AI audio
   - Clears any pending audio messages in the queue
   - Continues transcribing the user's speech
4. Once transcription is complete, the system processes the text and allows AI responses to resume

## Success Metrics
- **Response Time**: Time between speech detection and TTS interruption (target: <100ms)
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of speech correctly detected and transcribed
- **User Satisfaction**: Reduction in reported instances of AI and human speech overlap

### 4. Participant List and Speaking Indicators
- **Comprehensive Participant Display**: Show all participants in the conversation, including both human users and AI agents
- **Speaking Status Indicators**: Each participant should have a speaker/microphone icon that visually indicates their speaking status
- **Real-time Animation**: Speaking indicators should be animated to provide clear visual feedback about who is currently speaking
- **Transcription Status**: Human users with transcription enabled should show a distinct visual indicator when they are speaking and being transcribed
- **TTS Status**: AI agents should display a speaking indicator when they are actively using text-to-speech to communicate
- **Synchronized States**: All speaking indicators must be synchronized with the actual audio state to avoid confusion
- **Automatic Turn Management**: When an agent finishes speaking, its speaking indicator should automatically turn off during the queue processing to reflect the turn-taking behavior between agents

## Participant List UI Requirements

### Visual Design
- **Speaker Icons**: Each participant (human and agent) should have a microphone/speaker icon next to their name or avatar
- **Animation Effects**: When a participant is speaking, their icon should display a subtle animation (e.g., sound wave ripples, pulsing effect)
- **Color Coding**: Different states should use appropriate colors (e.g., green for active, gray for inactive)
- **Accessibility**: All visual indicators must have appropriate ARIA attributes and meet contrast requirements

### Interaction States
- **Human Speaking (Transcribing)**: When a human user is speaking and transcription is active, show an animated microphone icon
- **Agent Speaking (TTS)**: When an AI agent is using TTS, show an animated speaker icon
- **Idle State**: When no audio activity is detected, show the default non-animated icon
- **Transition Effects**: Smooth transitions between speaking and non-speaking states
- **Turn-Taking Behavior**: When multiple agents are in conversation, only one agent should show the speaking indicator at a time, reflecting the natural turn-taking in conversation

### Technical Implementation
- **State Management**: Centralized state management to track speaking status of all participants
- **Event System**: Event-based system to update UI indicators when speech is detected or TTS is active
- **Animation Framework**: Use CSS animations or a lightweight animation library for the speaking indicators
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure animations don't impact overall system performance
- **Queue Processing**: Implement a message queue system that automatically updates speaking states as messages are processed, ensuring that when an agent finishes speaking, its indicator is turned off before the next agent begins speaking
- **Message Completion Detection**: Accurately detect when a TTS message has completed playback to properly update the speaking state
- **Regimented State Changes**: Implement strict rules for state transitions with validation at each step
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Include multiple fallback options if primary TTS methods fail
- **Memory Management**: Carefully manage audio resources to prevent memory leaks during extended sessions
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test and optimize across all major browsers with graceful degradation

## System Reliability Requirements
- **Extended Session Support**: The system must maintain full functionality during extended sessions (8+ hours)
- **Resource Management**: Implement careful memory and resource management to prevent degradation over time
- **Automated Testing**: Develop comprehensive automated tests to verify TTS reliability
- **Monitoring**: Include internal monitoring to detect and report TTS performance issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: If issues occur, the system should degrade gracefully rather than failing completely
- **State Consistency**: Maintain consistent state between UI indicators and actual audio playback
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Implement self-healing mechanisms to recover from unexpected states

## Future Enhancements
- Implement speaker diarization to distinguish between different human speakers
- Add support for multiple languages
- Develop more sophisticated speech detection algorithms to reduce false positives
- Create visual feedback showing transcribed text in real-time
- Add voice activity visualization showing audio waveforms for active speakers
- Implement advanced diagnostics and analytics for TTS performance monitoring
