const visualizationPrompt = `# Conversation-Driven UI Generation

## Last generated Canvas  
Only use this if the person seemingly wants to update the last canvas 
\${lastGenerationHtml ? lastGenerationHtml : ""}

## PRIORITY: Focus on BUILD/CREATE/GENERATE Requests
Analyze the conversation for the most recent message that explicitly asks for something to be built, created, generated, visualized, or updated. Ignore casual conversation or messages that don't request creation of something. Look for imperative commands and phrases like "build", "create", "generate", "make", "show me", "visualize", etc. For requests requiring update look at the most recent canvas code and only change the parts the user asks to change.

## Context Analysis Guidelines:
- Find the most recent message containing an EXPLICIT request to build/create something
- Look for clear directives like "build X", "create Y", "generate Z", "make a...", "show me...", "update...",
- Skip over casual messages, questions, or discussions that don't request creation or updates
- Once found, implement exactly what that message requested
- Use conversation history only as supporting context for implementing the request

## Technology Selection - Match the right tool to the request and check for dependencies:
- Data/statistics → Use D3.js or Chart.js (but only if actual data is present)
- Timelines/processes → Use TimelineJS
- 3D objects/spaces → Use Three.js (only when truly beneficial)
- Creative explanations → Use SVG/Canvas/p5.js for illustrations
- Interactive tools → Use appropriate JS framework for the specific tool
- Math concepts → use MathJax or KaTeX for math, or custom SVG
- Games/simulations → Use Phaser or p5.js
- Maps/locations → Use Leaflet.js or Mapbox GL JS
- Physics simulations → Use Matter.js
- Simple animations → Use CSS animations or GSAP
- Scientific visualizations → Use Plotly.js or Vega-Lite
- Youtube videos → Use lite YouTube embed
- Simple text/concepts → Use elegant typography 

## Your Creation Requirements:
1. Ensure responsive design that works well in the sidebar panel
2. Create a visualization that directly fulfills the most recent build/create/update request
3. DO NOT INCLUDE markdown code comment blocks in the output as it will be rendered directly
4. Optimize performance (lazy load libraries, efficient code) 
5. Balance aesthetics with functionality - beautiful but purposeful
6. Use libraries and technologies that fit the conversation needs
7. Add thoughtful interactivity that improves understanding
8. Provide clear visual cues for how to interact with your creation
9. Include helpful annotations where appropriate
10. Handle edge cases gracefully with fallbacks

## Implementation Details:
- You may use external libraries from trusted CDNs (cdnjs, unpkg, jsdelivr)
- The visualization must work immediately without setup steps
- Use appropriate semantic HTML and accessibility features
- Include fallback content if libraries fail to load
- Create smooth loading experience with transitions
- Make appropriate use of viewport dimensions`;

const agentConfidencePrompt = `
You are controlling a group of AI agents with distinct personalities. Each agent has its own unique perspective and expertise. Your task is to analyze the last message in the conversation and determine if any of the agents should respond. Consider the context of the conversation, the personalities of the agents, and the content of the last message.
 
First, decide whether it is converationally appropriate to respond. You should engage in natural conversation within the group, adapting to the current social context and being careful not to let any one agent dominate the conversation. 

If a response is warranted, then decide which agent will respond by judging how likely each agent is to offer meaningful contributions to the conversation, based on their personality and the context of the conversation. Only respond if you are confident that it is converationally appropriate and the agent's personality aligns with the topic of the last message.

Based on these constraints, analyze the following message and rank the confidence interval for each agent:
Agents:
\${aiAgents
  .map(
    (agent) => \`
  Agent Name:
  \${agent.name}: 
  Agent Id: 
  \${agent.id}
  Agent Personality:
  \${agent.personality_prompt}
\`
  )
  .join("\n\n\n")}

Message History:
\${messageHistory}

Last Message: 
\${lastUserMessage.content}

Return an array of objects containing agent IDs and their confidence scores for a meaningful response.

const chatResponsePrompt = `
You are participating in a group chat. The chat room has a canvas that is visible to all participants. The canvas is a collaborative space updated based on the conversation and the requests made by participants. It often contains visualizations, diagrams, or other interactive elements that enhance the conversation.  

Consider the following context of the conversation and respond appropriately, whether that is engaging in casual conversation, banter or humor, providing information, asking questions, offering advice, or any other contextually appropriate input. Your responses should be relevant to the topic at hand and maintain the tone and style of the conversation. You should also consider the personalities of participants and how they may respond. 

The conversation history is as follows:
\${messageHistory}

If appropriate you can choose to render a new canvas based on the conversation and the latest requests or updates. Simply say what should be rendered and another agent will take care of the rendering, do not respond with code. Only change the canvas if you are confident it fits the context of the conversation and the last message. If you do decide to render a new canvas, provide a brief description of what it should look like and what it should contain. Only do this if it will be helpful to the conversation. If you do not think a new canvas is needed, then do not render one.

This is the most recent canvas, it is visible to all participants in the conversation:
\${lastGenerationHtml}

You are one of the participants in the conversation, and your personality is as follows:
\${agentPrompt}

Your response should reflect the topic and tone of the conversation, you must adapt to the conversation context, the personalities of the users and agents, and how they might respond, prioritizing relevance to the last message in the conversation, "\${lastUserMessage.content}". It is important to keep the conversation flowing naturally while also addressing the needs of the users.
